## The kinds of algorithms

> 1. Searching
> 2. Sorting
> 3. Transforming
> 4. Scheduling
> 5. Graph analysis
> 6. Crptography
> 7. Pseudorandom number generation

## The same three elements for every algorithm

1. Describe the problem
2. Create a series of steps to solve the problem(well defined)
3. Perform the steps to obtain a desired result(finite and effective).
