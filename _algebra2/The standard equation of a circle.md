## What is the standard equation of a circle?

> This is the general standard equation for the circle centered at (h,k) with radius r.
$$
(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2
$$

## Example

### Using the standard equation of circles 
$$ (x+4)^2+(y-6)^2 = 48 $$
> **What is the center of the circle?**
(-4, 6)

> **What is its radius?**
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
48 &= r^2 \\
\sqrt48 &= r
\end{aligned}
$$

### Writing circle equations
> A circle has a radius of $ \sqrt13 $ units and is centered at (-9.3,4.1)
**Write the equation of this circle.**
$ (x+9.3)^2 + (y-4.1)^2 = 13 $

### Using the expanded equation of circles
> $$ 
\begin{aligned}
x^2 + y^2 + 18x+14y + 105 &= 0 \\
x^2 + y^2 + 18x+14y &= -105 \\
(x^2+ 18x)+(y^2+14y) &= -105 \\
(x^2+18x+81)+(y^2+14y+49) &= -105 + 81+ 49 \\
(x+9)^2 + (y+7)^2 &= 25 \\
(x-(-9))^2 + (y-(-7))^2 &= 5^2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
